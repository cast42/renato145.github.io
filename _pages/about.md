Data scientist and machine learning researcher at the Artificial Intelligence Group at PUCP [(iapucp)](http://ia.inf.pucp.edu.pe/). I studied a MS in Computer Science at the Pontifical Catholic University of Perú (PUCP).

Things I like, in no particular order:
- Teaching.
- Movies (Kieślowski, Tarkovsky, Jodorowsky, ...sky).
- Cooking.
- Books, a little bit of everything. One particular favorite: The Museum of Eterna's Novel.
- Outdoors, camping.
